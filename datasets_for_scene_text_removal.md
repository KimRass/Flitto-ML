# Real-world Dataset
## ICDAR 2013
- includes 229 training images and 223 testing images.
## SCUT-EnsText
- containing 2,749 training images and 813 testing images, which are collected from ICDAR2013, ICDAR-2015, MS  COCO-Text, SVT, MLT-2019, and ArTs. The text instances of this dataset are in Chinese or English with diverse shapes, such as horizontal text, arbitrary quadrilateral text, and curved text. All text instances were carefully erased by annotators with good visual quality. By providing original text annotation and text-erased ground-truth, this dataset can be comprehensively used for both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
