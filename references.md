## Evaluation
### ICDAR 2013
- scene text dataset [16] contains 229 images for training and 233 for testing. The images were taken with a focus on the text instances. **We use the test set of this dataset to evaluate the results of text erasing in terms of recall, that is how much of the text in original images is detected in the images generated by our scene text eraser.**
- Synthetic dataset for scene text removal proposed in [39] contains 8000 training and 800 testing image pairs. An image pair consists of an image with text synthetically placed over it and its ground-truth image that does not contain any text as shown in Figure 3. We only use the test set to evaluate the performance of our method. Note that most of the images from the test set are also included in the training set; therefore, the dataset does not necessarily test the generalization abilities of a model when used for training.
- Real-world dataset for scene text removal created by Zhang et al. [39] consists of 1000 pairs of real images with scene text and their corresponding images with the text manually removed using a photo editing software as can be seen in Figure 3. The images were taken from a subset of images with English text from the MLT 2017 dataset.
